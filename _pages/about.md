Hi there!

I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Jonathan May](https://jonmay.github.io/webpage/). While obtaining a Master's in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University I worked closely with [Prof. Zachary Lipton](https://www.zacharylipton.com/), [Prof. Barnabas Poczos](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/) and [Prof. Rayid Ghani](https://www.rayidghani.com/). My undergraduate education was at the University of Toronto, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/) and [Prof. Vijay Ganesh](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/vijay-ganesh).

My research focuses on logical consistency, knowledge grounding, and controllability of Large Language Models. I have also worked on problems involving the robustness of AI systems, incorporating domain information into ML systems, and fairness in AI.

I try to write about subfields in NLP, with a wide range of interests covering: tool use in LLMs, factuality in LLMs, logical consistency, knowledge grounding, controllability, LLMs in RL settings, Web Agent, and more. You can find these posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@dhananjayashok99)
