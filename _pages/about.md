Hi there! I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Jonathan May](https://jonmay.github.io/webpage/) and [Prof. Jesse Thomason](https://jessethomason.com/). My research focuses on knowledge acquisition and grounding in Multimodal Language Models. I'm trying to build systems that can gather information from external sources, reason over the facts they infer, and perform intellectual tasks (e.g. editorial writing, detailed question answering) at an expert level. I mostly frequent NLP and ML conferences, with published work at venues such as NeurIPS, ACL and EMNLP. I [write](https://wordpress.com/home/dhananjayashok.law.blog) about AI knowledge grounding when I find the time.

While obtaining a Master's in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University, I worked on distribution shift with [Prof. Zachary Lipton](https://www.zacharylipton.com/), robustness and grounding in LLMs for science with [Prof. Barnabas Poczos](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/) and just deployment of AI systems with [Prof. Rayid Ghani](https://www.rayidghani.com/). My undergraduate education was at the University of Toronto, where I was advised by [Prof. Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/) and [Prof. Vijay Ganesh](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/vijay-ganesh).
  
Outside the lab, I try to hone my [cooking skills](https://www.instagram.com/foodboi19) and practice dancing salsa whenever possible. I enjoy playing basketball, volleyball, or football and have been an FC Bayern Munchen fan for a while now (soft spot for Tottenham Hotspur as well). I try learning more about things I'm curious about like cosmology, ancient Indian philosophy, public policy, and military strategy. I did a fair amount of Parliamentary Debating at the school and undergraduate level, and I help coach the [Indian National Debate team](https://indianschoolsdebatingsociety.com/wsdc-2019/) from time to time.
