Hi there!

I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Jonathan May](https://jonmay.github.io/webpage/). My research focuses on logical consistency, knowledge grounding, and controllability of Large Language Models. I'm primarily motivated by the pursuit of systems that can gather information from external sources, reason over the facts they infer, and perform skilled intellectual tasks (e.g. editorial writing, detailed question answering) at an expert level. 

I write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@dhananjayashok99) about interesting subfields in NLP, covering a wide range of interests like tool use in LLMs, factuality in LLMs, LLMs in RL settings, Web Agents, Long Form Questioning Answering and more.

While obtaining a Master's in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University I worked on distribution shift with [Prof. Zachary Lipton](https://www.zacharylipton.com/), robustness and grounding in LLMs for science with [Prof. Barnabas Poczos](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/) and fairness in AI with [Prof. Rayid Ghani](https://www.rayidghani.com/). My undergraduate education was at the University of Toronto, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/) and [Prof. Vijay Ganesh](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/vijay-ganesh).
  
Outside the lab, I try to [hone](https://someonezblog.wixsite.com/food/blog) my [cooking skills](https://www.instagram.com/foodboi19) and practice dancing salsa whenever possible. I enjoy playing basketball, volleyball, or football, and have been an FC Bayern Munchen fan for a while now (soft spot for Tottenham Hotspur as well). I try learning more about things I'm curious about like cosmology, ancient Indian philosophy, public policy, and military strategy. I did a fair amount of Parliamentary Debating at the school and undergraduate level, and I help coach the [Indian National Debate team](https://indianschoolsdebatingsociety.com/wsdc-2019/) from time to time.
